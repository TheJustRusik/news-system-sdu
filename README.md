# News system application

This is a news app. In fact, this is a practical assignment from my university, but I did a pretty good job on the design of this project and on its implementation, so for those who want to learn how to make javafx applications, this project can be shown quite rarely. I do not pretend to be a good authorization system (since it was not necessary according to the terms of reference). However, what can really be shown in the description is switching the application without closing / opening it and, of course, the design. The news module is also quite convenient, and how easy it is to update them and expand their number, which makes the application a very good example of extensibility.
